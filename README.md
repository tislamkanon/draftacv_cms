## ⚠️ Important Notes

### GitHub Pages Compatibility
Since GitHub Pages serves static files only, the blog posts are stored using the RESTful Table API provided by this platform. When deployed to GitHub Pages:

1. The CMS admin panel (`/admin/cms.html`) should be accessed from the deployed site, NOT locally
2. All data is stored in the cloud database, not in static files
3. Posts will automatically appear on the public blog once published

### Image Hosting
Since this is a static site, images must be hosted externally. Recommended options:
- Unsplash (for stock photos)
- Imgur
- GitHub repository (raw URLs)
- Any CDN or image hosting service
